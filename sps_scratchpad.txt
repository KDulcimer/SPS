Simple Packaging System

-All source tarballs will be XZ'd if possible.
-Upgrades will be based on time stamps, not version, epoch, or release. There is no epoch or release in SPS.
--How would we handle making sure a package is built against a certain version?
-What about when files aren't listed?
-Use Debian -dev, not RPM -devel. We don't want no steenkin' devil. Seriously, though, it's shorter, and shorter is better.
-Should we have a Priority tag?
-Automatic dependency checking
--Going to need a central database on the installed, local system which keeps a record of what's installed,
  what files each package provides, and the timestamp of the package.
--Use ldd
-How about package lists are generated based on changes from previous package lists?
--Let's think about this later.

XML
-Use tags, not "Group"
--New line delineated
-No changelog-- that will be covered in the GIT/SVN logs
-Need list of shorthand dirs

Source Storage
-(SVN|GIT)/packages/deadbeef:
--deadbeef.sps
--patches/
-(Ibiblio/mirrors)/sources/current/deadbeef-0.4.4.tar.xz
-(Ibiblio/mirrors)/sources/archive/deadbeef-0.4.3.tar.xz
-(Ibiblio/mirrors)/sources/archive/deadbeef-0.4.2.tar.xz
--Packagers should have local mirror set up. They should mirror at least the current directory.

Binary Tarballs
-metatdata (XML format)
--timestamp
--version
--
-deadbeef.tar (inside is /usr/bin, etc. Contents are copied to the file system.)
